"""
Synthesus 2.0 — Character Factory (Zero-LLM)
Auto-generate complete character genomes from a simple spec.

No LLM required. Uses archetype templates, combinatorial pattern
generation, and knowledge graph scaffolding to produce shippable
characters that pass validation and testing.

Usage:
    python3 character_factory_v2.py --name "Elda" --archetype innkeeper \
        --setting "medieval_fantasy" --traits "warm,gossipy,protective"

    python3 character_factory_v2.py --spec characters/specs/elda.json

Spec format:
    {
        "name": "Elda Brightwater",
        "id": "elda",
        "archetype": "innkeeper",
        "setting": "medieval_fantasy",
        "traits": ["warm", "gossipy", "protective"],
