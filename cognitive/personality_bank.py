"""
Module 7: Personality Bank
"When the player asks something creative, off-script, or personal"

Pre-authored creative responses organized by:
  - Archetype (merchant, guard, innkeeper, scholar, etc.)
  - Intent category (song, joke, favorite, opinion, personal, philosophical)
  - Emotion variant (neutral, friendly, suspicious, etc.)

This module replaces SLM generation for creative/personal questions.
Instead of generating text, it SELECTS from pre-written, QA-approved responses.

Responses can be loaded from a per-character personality.json file,
or fall back to built-in archetype defaults.

Cost: ~0.2ms per query, ~10 KB RAM per archetype, zero GPU.
